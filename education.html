        My education...

        <p>
            I was a student of Ady Endre Gimn√°zium from 2013 to 2017,
            in which year I suspended my studies due to personal matters and
            started learning coding. I had a private tutor who taught me basic
            webdevelopment, which later led us to work together on a startup called <a href="">IVOLV</a>.
            After a couple of <a href="">projects</a> I continued my studies in webdevelopment
            learning to use several tools, sources, and coding languages.

        <p>
            As of today I am still learning the craft, depeening my knowledge in as many related topics
            as I am capable of.
